They chose this location because it was close to the Oued Issil river, as water is needed for tanning. The second reason was that it was located far from the other parts of the city, as tanning is a smelly process. Like any other historical structure this old gate too has it’s share of legends.

Gueliz Mosque," Mosque of Guéliz, Marrakech 40000","The Gate of Bab Taghzout dates from the Almoravid era of Marrakech. This is the old northern entrance to the city. It is located near the center of Marrakech. It is a magnificent historical monument, from where you can get lost in the streets, go through Diar Saboun street and go to see the Ben Youssef Mosque. It is a less touristy district, much quieter than the souk district.
