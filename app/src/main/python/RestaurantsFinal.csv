Vegetation wraps the lounge garden and on the cosy sofas one can unwind with delight. Then appear the indoor bar areas which would like to be hidden behind light Murano glass curtains. In this journey back through the Art Deco period we can only feel softness and intimacy. Under the amazing glasshouse, palm trees, yuccas, banana trees spread their branches around the blue and green water of a peaceful basin...In the evenings, romantic candlelight dinners can take place in this illuminated theatre. In the Bill Willis eating rooms, the arches, domes, zellige decors, striped tadelakt tell about the Yves Saint-Laurent’s glorious Marrakech. From the very beginning La Trattoria has always celebrated Italian gastronomy. The lunches, garden lounge afternoons and dinners are a true feast. The delicate cuisine echoes the refinement of the place.

Handcarved cedar woodwork, ornate sculpture and carvings, handsome waiters dressed in loose white cotton, trays elegantly poised above their right shoulder��� it���s a magical world. A formal dining space, Palais Gharnat specialises is Morroccan cuisine.

The best tables are on the mezzanine, overlooking the set-piece central fountain. ; Moroccan ; Lunch, Dinner, Brunch, Late Night ; Reservations, Seating, Wheelchair Accessible, Serves Alcohol, Table Service ;   ; Palacio da Bahia,Dar Si Said Museum,Musee Tiskiwin,Angsana Spa Morocco, ; Riad Melhoun & Spa,Riad Chennaoui,Riad Nora,Riad Hayati,","cafe,extrablatt,derb,el,arsa,riad,zitoun,jdid,medina,marrakech,morocco,moroccan,lunch,dinner,brunch,late,night,reservation,seating,wheelchair,accessible,serve,alcohol,table,service,palacio,da,bahia,dar,si,say,museum,musee,tiskiwin,angsana,spa,morocco,riad,melhoun,spa,riad,chennaoui,riad,nora,riad,hayati",618,/maps/dir//Cafe+Extrablatt+Marrakech/data=!4m6!4m5!1m1!4e2!1m2!1m1!1s0xdafeef5f56b5147:0xe2f52f1a7541d809?sa=X
